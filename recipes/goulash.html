        <li>1 medium onion, chopped</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 (15 oz) can tomato sauce</li>
        <li>1 (14.5 oz) can diced tomatoes</li>
        <li>1 (6 oz) can tomato paste</li>
        <li>2 cups elbow macaroni (or any pasta of choice)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon Italian seasoning</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon pepper</li>
        <li>1 cup shredded cheddar cheese (optional, for topping)</li>
        <li>2 cups water or beef broth</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large skillet or pot, cook the ground beef over medium heat until browned. Drain any excess fat.</li>
        <li>Add the chopped onion and minced garlic to the skillet. Cook for 2-3 minutes until the onion becomes translucent.</li>
        <li>Stir in the tomato sauce, diced tomatoes, tomato paste, Italian seasoning, salt, and pepper. Mix well.</li>

        <li>Once the pasta is cooked and the sauce has thickened, remove from heat.</li>
        <li>If desired, sprinkle shredded cheddar cheese over the top and cover until the cheese melts.</li>
