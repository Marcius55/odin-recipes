    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts</li>
        <li>200g pasta (penne, fusilli, or spaghetti)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1/2 cup sun-dried tomatoes, chopped</li>
        <li>2 cups fresh spinach</li>
        <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
        <li>1/2 cup chicken broth</li>
        <li>1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>Fresh parsley, chopped (for garnish)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook the pasta according to the package instructions. Drain and set aside.</li>
        <li>Season the chicken breasts with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the chicken breasts and cook until golden brown on both sides and cooked through, about 6-7 minutes per side. Remove the chicken from the skillet and set aside.</li>
        <li>In the same skillet, add the garlic and sauté for 1 minute until fragrant.</li>
        <li>Add the sun-dried tomatoes and spinach to the skillet. Cook until the spinach wilts, about 2-3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Pour in the heavy cream and chicken broth, stirring to combine. Bring to a simmer and cook for 2-3 minutes until the sauce thickens slightly.</li>
        <li>Add the cooked pasta to the skillet, tossing to coat in the sauce. Add the Parmesan cheese and stir until melted and creamy.</li>
        <li>Slice the cooked chicken and add it to the skillet with the pasta. Toss everything together and heat through.</li>
        <li>Season with salt and pepper to taste, then garnish with fresh parsley before serving.</li>
